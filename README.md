# GE Aviation Forage Internship

This project was completed as part of the GE Aviation Forage Internship. The objective of the project was to use data engineering techniques to combine full-flight engine data, part manufacturing data, and airport location data to create a data lake that can be used by analysts.


## Tasks

The following tasks were completed as part of this project:

- Combined full-flight engine data, part manufacturing data, and airport location data to create a data lake.
